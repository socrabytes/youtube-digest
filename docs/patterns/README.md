## Adding New Patterns

When you discover a new pattern during development:

1. Create a new file using [pattern-template.md](./pattern-template.md)
2. Document the pattern with:
   - When to use it
   - Implementation details
   - Code examples
   - Error handling
3. Add it to this README under the appropriate category
4. Reference the issue/task where it was established
