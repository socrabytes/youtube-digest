# Issue #34: Implement Video Library View

*Sub-issue from #33*

## Status: [Almost Complete]

## User Story
As a user,
I want a clean and organized view of my processed videos
So that I can easily browse, search, and access my video library.

## Description
This task involves implementing the main video library interface using Next.js, creating a responsive layout, and handling video metadata display and interactions with the newly refactored backend API.

## Technical Context
The backend API has been refactored (Issue #45) to work with a normalized database schema (Issue #33). The frontend needs to be updated to work with this new API structure, which includes:

- Separate endpoints for videos, channels, transcripts, and digests
- Field mapping strategy for API compatibility (e.g., `url` instead of `webpage_url`)
- Enhanced metadata and relationships between entities

## Acceptance Criteria

### Grid/List View Implementation
- [x] Toggle between grid and list views
- [x] Responsive layout (mobile-first approach)
- [x] Proper spacing and alignment
- [x] Smooth transitions between views

### Video Card Component
- [x] Display all required metadata:
  - [x] Thumbnail
  - [x] Title
  - [x] Channel name
  - [x] Duration
  - [x] Published date
  - [x] View count
- [x] Proper thumbnail handling and fallbacks
- [x] Loading states implemented
- [x] Error states handled
- [x] Interactive elements (hover effects, focus states)

### User Interactions
- [x] Click handling for video details
- [x] Quick summary preview on hover
- [x] Sort options (date, title, channel)
- [x] Basic filters (by category, duration)
- [x] Pagination or infinite scroll

### Performance & Testing
- [x] Lazy loading for images and content
- [ ] Component tests for all new components
- [ ] Responsive design tested across devices
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Progress

### Completed
- Initial project setup
- Created reusable VideoGrid and VideoList components
- Implemented responsive grid/list toggle
- Added video card component with thumbnail, title, channel, duration, and metadata
- Implemented sorting functionality
- Added filtering by categories and duration
- Created error display and empty state components
- Added keyboard shortcuts for navigation and accessibility
- Enhanced navigation between Library and Digests views
- Fixed thumbnails and loading states
- Added pagination controls

### In Progress
- Testing on different screen sizes
- Final polish and refinements

### To Do
- Add automated tests for components
- Optimize performance for large video libraries

## Implementation Highlights

### Grid and List Views
The video library now supports both grid and list views with a simple toggle:
- Grid view: Displays videos in a responsive card layout with consistent sizing
- List view: Shows videos in a more detailed horizontal layout
- Users can switch views with UI buttons or keyboard shortcuts (g/l)

### Video Cards
Each video card now includes:
- Properly sized thumbnail with duration overlay
- Fixed-height title area with truncation for long titles
- Channel information with proper fallbacks
- Clear digest indicator badge
- View count and relative date display (e.g., "2 days ago")

### Filtering and Sorting
Users can now filter videos by:
- Duration (Any, Short, Medium, Long)
- Categories (automatically populated from available videos)
- Search term (filters both title and channel)

Sorting options include:
- Date (newest/oldest)
- Views (highest/lowest)
- Title (A-Z/Z-A)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Added keyboard shortcuts for power users:
- `g`: Switch to grid view
- `l`: Switch to list view
- `s`: Focus search box
- `f`: Toggle filters panel
- `?`: View keyboard shortcuts help
- Arrow keys: Navigate pagination

### Navigation Improvements
- Enhanced navigation between Library and Digests views
- Back button to return to Library from Digests
- Direct linking to specific videos

### User Experience Enhancements
- Consistent loading indicators using LoadingSpinner component
- EmptyState component for zero-results scenarios
- ErrorDisplay component for proper error handling
- Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Notes
- The design should follow the existing application style guide
- Performance is a key consideration, especially for large video libraries
- The implementation should leverage the relationships in the normalized database schema
