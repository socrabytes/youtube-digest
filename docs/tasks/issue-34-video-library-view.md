# Issue #34: Implement Video Library View

*Sub-issue from #33*

## Status: [In Progress]

## User Story
As a user,
I want a clean and organized view of my processed videos
So that I can easily browse, search, and access my video library.

## Description
This task involves implementing the main video library interface using Next.js, creating a responsive layout, and handling video metadata display and interactions with the newly refactored backend API.

## Technical Context
The backend API has been refactored (Issue #45) to work with a normalized database schema (Issue #33). The frontend needs to be updated to work with this new API structure, which includes:

- Separate endpoints for videos, channels, transcripts, and digests
- Field mapping strategy for API compatibility (e.g., `url` instead of `webpage_url`)
- Enhanced metadata and relationships between entities

## Acceptance Criteria

### Grid/List View Implementation
- [ ] Toggle between grid and list views
- [ ] Responsive layout (mobile-first approach)
- [ ] Proper spacing and alignment
- [ ] Smooth transitions between views

### Video Card Component
- [ ] Display all required metadata:
  - [ ] Thumbnail
  - [ ] Title
  - [ ] Channel name
  - [ ] Duration
  - [ ] Published date
  - [ ] View count
- [ ] Proper thumbnail handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] Error states handled
- [ ] Interactive elements (hover effects, focus states)

### User Interactions
- [ ] Click handling for video details
- [ ] Quick summary preview on hover
- [ ] Sort options (date, title, channel)
- [ ] Basic filters (by category, duration)
- [ ] Pagination or infinite scroll

### Performance & Testing
- [ ] Lazy loading for images and content
- [ ] Component tests for all new components
- [ ] Responsive design tested across devices
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```
components/
  ├── video/
  │   ├── VideoGrid.tsx
  │   ├── VideoList.tsx
  │   ├── VideoCard.tsx
  │   ├── VideoDetails.tsx
  │   ├── VideoFilters.tsx

  │   └── ErrorState.tsx
  └── layout/
      └── LibraryLayout.tsx
```

### API Integration
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implement proper error handling for API requests
- Create type-safe interfaces for all API responses

### State Management
- Use React Context for library view preferences
- Local component state for UI interactions
- React Query for server state

## Progress

### Completed
- Initial project setup

### In Progress
- Component structure planning
- API integration strategy

### To Do
- Implement VideoGrid and VideoList components
- Create VideoCard component with all required features
- Add sorting and filtering functionality
- Implement pagination/infinite scroll
- Add tests for all components
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility

## Notes
- The design should follow the existing application style guide
- Performance is a key consideration, especially for large video libraries
- The implementation should leverage the relationships in the normalized database schema
