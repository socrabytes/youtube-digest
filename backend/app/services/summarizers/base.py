Generate a well-formatted, structured summary using Markdown that:

## Guidelines
- Use clear section headings with markdown (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
- Use bullet points (‚Ä¢) for lists to improve scannability
- Make timestamps clickable by formatting them as [00:00](t=0)
- Use bold text for **key terms** and emphasis
- Incorporate emojis sparingly to highlight key points (üîë for important insights, üìã for summaries, üéØ for objectives)
- Keep the total length under 400 words

## Output Structure
1. "## üìã Summary" - A concise overview (50-75 words)
2. "## üîë Key Points" - 3-5 bullet points highlighting the most important insights
3. "## üìö Content Overview" - Brief explanation of what the video covers
4. "## üìù Detailed Notes" - More in-depth coverage of important concepts

Make your summary informative, scannable, and focused on the most valuable information."""
